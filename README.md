# Sorting Header File Project (C)

This project is a modular sorting library implemented in the C programming language using header files. It allows users to sort arrays of different data types by simply including a single header file in their program.

The project is menu-driven and enables users to choose both the **data type**
and the **sorting algorithm** at runtime.
